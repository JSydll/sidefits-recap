    "FAQ_SITE_BODY": "<h3>WorkoutCloud: General</h3><br /><br /> <p> <i>What is the WorkoutCloud?</i> </p><p> The WorkoutCloud is an online platform that suggests you the most versatile workouts based on your preferences. Users can search by selecting certain tags like Abs, Biceps, Weight loss etc. The WorkoutCloud is smart: if you&#8217;re logged in and like workouts, it analyses the workouts&#8217; structure and improves the recommendations for you! </p><p> <i>Where do the workouts come from?</i> </p><p> The workouts are user generated, created with our Workout Creator. Those people are usually the ones who know a lot about fitness and health like Personal trainer or people who just work out a lot and are well informed! </p><p> <i>Where do the exercise come from?</i> </p><p> The Sidefits team chose 150+ bodyweighted exercises to account for maximum versatility! People who create workouts can choose from those or can suggest new exercises which will be tested for suitability by our sports scientists. </p><p> <i>I am afraid I hurt myself, are the exercises safe?</i> </p><p> All exercises are common exercises, compiled by our team and tested by sports scientists. If you perform the exercises properly, you won&#8217;t hurt yourself. If you are not sure how to do an exercise, contact us for help or do another one! However, working out using the WorkoutCloud is on your own responsibility and we cannot be held liable. </p><br /><h3>WorkoutCloud: Creator</h3><br /><br /> <p> <i>How can I create workouts?</i> </p><p> Click on the button in the lower right corner on the screen. You will see the summary of your workout in the top and the modules to create the workout in the lower part. A random name and picture for your workout is created by default in case you cannot come up with one. Feel free to change it! </p><p> By clicking &#8222;+ exercises&#8220; you can choose exercises for your workout. Search exercises the following way: </p><p> &#183; Type in the exercise name directly (e.g. situp) </p><p> &#183; Type in the body part to see related exercises (e.g. Legs) </p><p> &#183; Type in the muscle group to see related exercises (e.g. biceps) </p><p> After choosing an exercise, you have to select a time, number of repetitions or distance the exercise should be performed! </p><p> By clicking &#8222;+ break&#8220; you will add a break to the workout. As bodyweighted workouts are oftentimes high intensity workuts where cardio, strength and muscular endurance are combined, you might want to add a break. </p><p> By clicking &#8222;+round&#8220; you will add another round. If you want the following rounds of your workout to be exactly like the first round, you can just click the copy symbol of the first round! Easy, right? </p><p> You can drag and drop exercises and rounds while creating a workout if you want them in another place! </p><p> An estimated time and difficulty of the workout will be automatically calculated. The calculated time is a rough case, based on the time it takes to do one repetition of each exercise. Therefore, these times do not include breaks you might need and do not vary with the level of the athlete. <br /> The difficulty has been decided on by Sidefits and can also differ from person to person. </p><p> After creating a workout, share it with your friends by facebook or email! Other users will be suggested your workout! The more people like your workout, the more relevant it becomes in the content ranking. </p><br /><h3>FitTest</h3><br /><br /> <p> <i>What is the FitTest and how do I benefit?</i> </p><p> The Sidefits FitTest is an objective and short test of your physical fitness. It has been developed together with sports scientists, based on the latest research findings. It tests your performance in the dimensions of flexibility, muscular strength, muscular endurance and cardio. </p><p> Our team will analyse your test results individually and you will see in which test, dimension and overall you perform compared to the average. If you like, we give you recommendations for improving your weaknesses. <br /> At the moment, the FitTest is just available in German, an English version will be released soon! </p>"
