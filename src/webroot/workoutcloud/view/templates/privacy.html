    <h3>I General</h3>
    <p>
    The concept of the Sidefits online platform relies to a great extent on the publication of information regarding individual users to other users by making them accessible via the Sidefits web application. All users can freely access the public profile information (picture, name), training information (created and liked workouts) and network information (followings and followers) of all other users. Sidefits website users do not have the option to change that. By using the website, users explicitly consent that other users may see the information named above.
    If users do not want other users to get access to their information, they have to leave their profile empty and they have to make sure to not create or like any workouts. If they accidentally do so, they have to delete them in their profile.
    Email addresses will not be shared with any other user.
    They may, however, be automatically added to the Sidefits mailing lists. From time to time Sidefits may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.

    <h3>IV Facebook Integration</h3>
    <p>
    The Sidefits application integrates different connection to the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. They are used to share activities on Facebook and to get Facebook information about Sidefits' application users. An overview of Facebook integrations and social plugins can be found here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
    When users enable the Facebook connection, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. Thereby, Sidefits receives information about the user. This information will be treated as stated in section III.
    When users invite friends via Facebook, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. That allows the user to gain information about his or her friends via the Sidefits application. Sidefits as the provider of the Sidefits application does not receive any of this information.
    When users share their performances on Facebook and when they invite friends via Facebook, the Facebook integration establishes a connection between a user and the Facebook server. Thereby, the user links information of his Sidefits account to his or her Facebook account. That allows Facebook to correlate a user's usage of the Sidefits application with the corresponding users Facebook account. Sidefits as the provider of the Sidefits application does not have any knowledge of the future data usage by Facebook. Users can find more information on that issue in the privacy policy of Facebook at: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
    Users have to actively enable the Facebook connection by signing in in order to be able to share content from the Sidefits application on Facebook and invite friends via Facebook. If users do not want Facebook to gain information on their Sidefits application usage or if they don't want Sidefits to gain information about them via Facebook, they shall leave the Facebook integration disabled and register with email.
    By activating the Facebook connection, the user explicitly consents to the information exchange described in this section.
